## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first time using CSS Grid in a project. While setting up the grid initially took some time, it made positioning elements much easier afterward. Next time, I plan to define a main grid layout for the entire page and use Flexbox for simpler, one-directional layouts within sections.

### Responsive Design
The site is responsive, with layouts for mobile and tablet devices at the following breakpoints:
```css
/* TABLET */

@media (max-width: 768px) {
}

/* MOBILE */

@media (max-width: 375px) {
}
```
